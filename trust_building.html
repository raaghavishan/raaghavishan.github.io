          <h2>Summer Internship </h2>
          <h5 style="color:#8c8c8c">April-May 2020</h5>

        <p>  This was entirely an online Internship at Capillary technologies. I did this internship along with my friend Diksha.
          It is about designing interfaces for Trust building in Artificial intelligence where making artificial intelligent marketing
          campaigns more human like. It is mainly based on their Engage+ product which is an AI-powered customer engagement and campaign automation platform.
        </p>
        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>We joined as the UX design interns and work was mostly on Trust building in AI.
The project was started with secondary research to get some answers for the questions
<ul>
  <li> How enterprise AI works?</li>
  <li>What is Trust?</li>
  <li>How to build trust?</li>
  <li>How AI assistants help in building trust between AI and Human?</li>
</ul>
We watched the 2001:Space Odessey film to get an idea on how they develop trust in a Super computer called HAL 9000.
</p>
<p>
  We had daily meetups with the team every morning. The  discussions were over google meet , and created a timeline to follow.
Initially Diksha and I were finding difficult to collaborate over online after a figured our way out by scheduling meetings amongst ourselves everyday and was having common doc for our documentation.
We shared our ideas and developed them together.  We sketched the ideas together and finally made it happen
</p>
<h2>Learnings</h2>
<p>Working from home in the pandemic situation was challenging but it gave time for the development of new
skills. This internship helped me understand the design process in the corporate, how they approach things and how
things are broken down to be solved. This internship mostly increased my knowledge on the business sector, on how
companies keep track of their customers, and how they analyse data and most importantly how AI is going to take
over the future.
I learned on how to design language for a particular organisation can be created, what are the standards
they use to create screens and how they are used. Importantly I learned on how to use a tool properly by knowing all
of its functions and features</p>
